# Nesting Dolls Code
# Like nesting dolls, nest 'if' statements within 'if' statements. Create a game to find true fans of your favorite show.

# Nesting
# Nesting is where we put an if statement within an if statement using the power of indenting. The second if statement within the first if statement must be indented and its print statement needs to be indented one more time.
