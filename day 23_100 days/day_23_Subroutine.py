# Subroutines: The Recipe for Coding
# Write code in a way where you can use it, call it, or repeat it anywhere and at anytime with the power of subroutines.

# Ok you might have cracked my earlier login but let's try a better one üîê ! Day 23 of #Replit100DaysOfCode #100DaysOfCode. Join me on @Replit https://join.replit.com/python


print("Subroutine")

'''So far, when we wanted to repeat code, we have had to use loops or copy and paste code.

What if I told you there was a way to use code or call it and use it anytime anywhere??

That is a subroutine!!

A subroutine tells the computer that a piece of code exists and to go run that code again and again...
Just like a recipe

Subroutines work like a recipe in a cookbook. If you want to know how to make a cake, you don't have to start from scratch every time. You can use a recipe to get the same quality each time.'''
